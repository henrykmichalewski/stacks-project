	stacks-project -- algebraic stacks project


Collaborative web-based project writing a text book on algebraic stacks and the
algebraic geometry that is needed to define them. Location on the web:

	https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/

You can simply latex the files in the current directory read them, edit them,
and submit your changes by email back into the project.


Here is are some pointers to documentation:
  * how to create all dvi/pdf files at once, see documentation/make-project
  * how to submit your work, see documentation/submitting-patches
  * how to use git, see documentation/git-howto
  * read about support from organizations in documentation/support
  * for a rough todo list, see documentation/todo-list
  * for technical rules governing internal references, see documentation/rules

## Dependency Graph

A Python script in `scripts/dependency_graph.py` can generate a graph of references between labelled environments. It writes a Graphviz DOT file and optional JSON description. With `--tex` it outputs a TeX document containing a theorem and all dependencies.

Examples:

```bash
python3 scripts/dependency_graph.py . --dot deps.dot --json
python3 scripts/dependency_graph.py . --tex lemma-silly --tex-out deps.tex
python3 scripts/dependency_graph.py . --tex lemma-silly \
  --lean-path ../mathlib4 --tex-out deps.tex
python3 scripts/dependency_graph.py . \
  --tex lemma-equality-genus-reduction-bigger-than \
  --lean-path ../mathlib4-master --tex-out genus.tex
python3 scripts/dependency_graph.py . \
  --tex lemma-weil-additive \
  --lean-path ../mathlib4-master --tex-out weil.tex
python3 scripts/dependency_graph.py . \
  --tex lemma-topological-invariance \
  --lean-path ../mathlib4-master --tex-out invariance.tex
```

The optional `--lean-path` argument points to a mathlib4 checkout. When
provided, Lean snippets for Stacks tags referenced in mathlib are inserted
after each environment in the generated TeX.

Running the second command produces a TeX document with the theorem
and its referenced environments.  For example the current output for
`lemma-silly` is

```tex
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-silly}
Let $X$ be a spectral space. Let
$$
\xymatrix{
Y \ar[r] \ar[d] & T \ar[d] \\
X \ar[r] & \pi_0(X)
}
$$
be a cartesian diagram in the category of topological spaces
with $T$ profinite. Then $Y$ is spectral and $T = \pi_0(Y)$.
If moreover $X$ is w-local, then $Y$ is w-local, $Y \to X$ is w-local,
and the set of closed points of $Y$ is the inverse image of the
set of closed points of $X$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{situation}
\label{situation-setup}
Here $S$ is a scheme and $B$ is an algebraic space over $S$.
We assume $B$ is quasi-separated, locally Noetherian, and
universally catenary (Decent Spaces, Definition
\ref{decent-spaces-definition-universally-catenary}).
Moreover, we assume given a dimension function
$\delta : |B| \longrightarrow \mathbf{Z}$.
We say $X/B$ is {\it good} if $X$ is an algebraic space
over $B$ whose structure morphism $f : X \to B$ is
quasi-separated and locally of finite type.
In this case we define
$$
\delta = \delta_{X/B} : |X| \longrightarrow \mathbf{Z}
$$
as the map sending $x$ to $\delta(f(x))$ plus the transcendence degree
of $x/f(x)$ (Morphisms of Spaces, Definition
\ref{spaces-morphisms-definition-dimension-fibre}).
This is a dimension function by
More on Morphisms of Spaces, Lemma
\ref{spaces-more-morphisms-lemma-universally-catenary-dimension-function}.
